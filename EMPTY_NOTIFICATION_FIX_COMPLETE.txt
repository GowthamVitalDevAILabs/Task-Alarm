  ✅ EMPTY NOTIFICATION CONTENT FIX - COMPLETED!
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🎉 Empty notification issue has been fixed!

📊 ISSUES FIXED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Issue 1: Empty Notification Popups
   Problem: Notifications appeared without title, body, or content
   Fix: Ensured all content fields have fallback values

✅ Issue 2: Inconsistent Notification Display
   Problem: Sometimes notifications didn't display at all
   Fix: Added banner display and badge for visibility

✅ Issue 3: No Action Buttons
   Problem: Snooze/Dismiss buttons not showing
   Fix: Enabled notification with proper category settings
   Note: Action buttons may not display in Expo Go (platform limitation)

🔧 WHAT WAS CHANGED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

File: src/services/NotificationService.ts

1. Enhanced Notification Content Structure
   - Title fallback: "Alarm" if empty
   - Body fallback: "Wake up!" if empty
   - Added subtitle: "Task Alarm"
   - Added badge: 1 for visibility
   - Ensured data and sound have fallbacks

2. Enabled Banner Display
   - Changed: shouldShowBanner: false → shouldShowBanner: shouldShow
   - Changed: shouldShowAlert: false → shouldShowAlert: shouldShow
   - Result: Notifications now display as banner at top

3. Enhanced Logging
   - Shows title and body before scheduling
   - Shows complete notification content
   - Helps debug empty notifications
