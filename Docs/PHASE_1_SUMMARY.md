  - getSoundName()

### 8. README.md ✅
Created project README with:
- Feature list
- Quick start guide
- Project structure overview
- Documentation links
- Development status
- Tech stack
- Development commands

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Context-Driven Development Approach
Adopted comprehensive documentation strategy inspired by the Vital-LLM-Chat-Navigator project, ensuring:
- All architectural decisions are documented
- APIs are well-defined before implementation
- Development can proceed efficiently with AI assistance
- Future developers can understand the system quickly

### 2. TypeScript Strict Mode
Enabled strict TypeScript configuration for:
- Early error detection
- Better code quality
- Improved IDE support
- Safer refactoring

### 3. Service Layer Architecture
Designed clear separation of concerns:
- Services handle business logic
- Context manages state
- Components focus on UI
- Utilities provide reusable functions

### 4. Android-First Approach
Focused on Android platform:
- Simplified testing and development
- Platform-specific optimizations possible
- iOS support can be added later

## Metrics

### Files Created
- Documentation: 5 files (PROJECT_CONTEXT, ARCHITECTURE, API_REFERENCE, DEVELOPMENT, PHASE_1_SUMMARY)
- Source Code: 3 files (alarm.types.ts, alarm.constants.ts, sounds.ts)
- Configuration: 1 file (app.json updated)
- README: 1 file

### Dependencies Installed
- Total packages: 10 core packages
- No vulnerabilities found
- All compatible with Expo SDK 54

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode: ✅ Enabled
- Linter errors: 0
- Type coverage: 100%

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Project initializes without errors
- [x] All folders created correctly
- [x] All documentation files present and complete
- [x] app.json configured for Android with all permissions
- [x] All dependencies installed successfully
- [x] TypeScript types compile without errors
- [x] No linter warnings or errors
- [x] Constants properly defined
- [x] README.md provides clear overview

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

Ready to proceed with Phase 2: Core Services & Business Logic

1. **StorageService.ts** - AsyncStorage wrapper with CRUD operations
2. **timeCalculations.ts** - Time calculation utilities
3. **NotificationService.ts** - Notification channel and permission management
4. **SchedulerService.ts** - Alarm scheduling logic

## Notes

- Sound files will be added in Phase 6 (currently using placeholders)
- The foundation is solid and scalable
- Documentation provides clear roadmap for all future phases
- Type safety ensures fewer runtime errors
- Architecture supports future enhancements (cloud sync, native modules)

## Issues/Blockers

None - Phase 1 completed successfully!

## Developer Notes

The context-driven development approach is working excellently. Having comprehensive documentation upfront makes implementation straightforward and reduces decision paralysis. The architecture is clean, modular, and follows React Native best practices.
